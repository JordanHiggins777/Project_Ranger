<summary> The Shell </summary>

   In order to make the shell we need we had to take "The best of both worlds"

  So chop shop both and you may see where this is going 
   
  <img width="300" src="https://github.com/JordanHiggins777/Project_Ranger/blob/main/Chop.PNG"> 
      
      
 Now we have to epoxy

Time to sand off the imperfections
                        

  <img width="300" src="https://github.com/JordanHiggins777/Project_Ranger/blob/main/Sand.PNG"> 
                        
                        
            
And now for a layer of primer
   
   <img width="300" src="https://github.com/JordanHiggins777/Project_Ranger/blob/main/Primer.PNG"> 
    
After this cuts have to be made to fit things like a battery, oled, pi, rev trigger(ect)
