<summary> The Shell </summary>
<br>

   In order to make the shell we need we had to take "The best of both worlds"

  So chop shop both and you may see where this is going

 Now we have to epoxy

But this looks sloppy and unatural so its time to put some spot putty on

Time to sand off the imperfections

And now for a layer of primer

After this cuts have to be made to fit things like a battery, oled, pi, rev trigger(ect)

   Overall the shell has been a project in it self. Getting all the required epoxies and getting access to things like a bandsaw and dremel were tasks in of themselfs. Its been going well and this may be the part of the project that gets finished this year.
